MoveLayers - undo of deleting a layer with stuff on it.   


-------------------- HID Validation Stuff --------------------

[gtk]

[user controlled menus for gtk]
- Test all menu actions.

- Compare all hotkeys from the hard coded system to the new resource file
  controlled system.  We're looking for no/minimal user visible change
  when the usermenu branch is merged

- Make sure loading a new board updates all the displayed menu checkmarks

- play around with the route style buttons and menus to see if it gets 
  confused ever.

- make sure settings are always saved

- make sure that we're compatible with the lesstif hid as far as being able to 
  load the same menu resource file if we want

- implement the @routestyles menu

- move all key press events out of gui-output-events and run them through the
  menu actions.  Then create a "hotkey" menu for all of the things which 
  have/need hotkeys but are not normally menu items.  This provides a
  convenient key reference.  I suppose I could make that invisible if
  people don't like seeing it.

- compare performace before and after over a slow link or on a slow computer.

- make the ui append code more printf()-like.  It will simplify the code
  and make it nicer to read.

- look for code duplication in hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c, especially related to
  layers and tools.  Don't duplicate code if at all possible.

[existing before user controlled menus]

Do something with LayerGroupsChanged action.


Verify all config items are saved/loaded properly.

Review for additions to make to the Preferences window.

Clean up popup: populate with common actions and remove select tool part.
Evaluate its value given tearoff menus?


-------------------- Lesstif Enhancements --------------------

Pan(x, y, zoomfactor) - pans screen, zooms, sets crosshairs on coordinate.

Translucent layers

Layer/Group master control dialog

Remember configuration and restore on startup?


-------------------- HID Enhancements --------------------

PNG: get clears right.
PNG: add options for gif and jpeg.  Maybe this HID needs
     a different name...
PNG: add option to specify output image max dimension
 
Add direct-to-pdf exporter?

Put Xaw GUI back in?


-------------------- Core Issues/Enhancements ---------------

SearchObjectByLocation() needs to search front side silk, elements,
etc, before back side ones.


-------------------- Action Enhancements --------------------

Default functions for ":"
 - tab expansion

Generic "set hid attribute" action.


-------------------- Long Term Projects --------------------

Switch to topological autorouter.

Global "puller" optimizer.

Constrain all objects to have the same fields first in their data
structures; convert most internal functions to use this AnyObject type
instead of N functions for N object types.  (Prelude to C++ objects?)

Win32 and MacOS HIDs.
